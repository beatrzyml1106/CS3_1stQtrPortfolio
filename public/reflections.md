# Beatriz's Reflections

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1. **Variable declaration.** -  Since I have had a good foundation and knowledge in Python and C++, I was able to pick this lesson up quickly. For me, this lesson was very easy and understandable.

2. **JavaScript Operators.** -  This lesson was pretty much logic or common sense. Again, since I already have a good knowledge with other programming languages, it didn't take me long to master this lesson as it was mostly similar to c++.

3. **Control Statements** - This is my favorite CS3 lesson so far. Control statements are very easy to understand, especially with my prior knowledge in other programming languages. We also had many exercises that helped me really master the topic.

4. **Loop Control Structures** - Loops were also something I learned and mastered in 8th grade. The logic behind this topic is not hard or complex. We also had some practice in class with this topic.

5. **JavaScript Basic Statements** - Since I was able to practice and use JavaScript a lot this quarter, I was able to learn and apply this topic a lot. In almost every exercise, this lesson is used so I could master it this quarter. Again, the logic behind the statements are also very simple.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

1. **Declaring Functions** - I learned this topic in 8th grade so I didn't have a hard time. I already got the hang of it, especially with the many exercises I had with this topic. However, I haven't mastered this as much as the other topics, so it is one of my weaker areas.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. **Practice !** - I will do more exercise and practice on my own, applying these topics, in order for me to really master them at my own pace too. 

2. **Research !** - I will do some more research about these topics, in other websites and the provided lectures in KHub.

3. **Consult !** - If I really can not understand the topic, I will consult with my teacher about them.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective 

1. **Kahoot practices !!** - This activity was very fun for me and really pushed me to understand each question/topic more. I think really engaging activities like this helps and is more fun for the class.

2. **In-class coding exercises !!** - In my opinion, in-class coding exercises are better than homework. First of all, it really gives the students a chance to help one another in case they don't understand what to do. I find doing schoolwork much more fun and easier when I'm with others. Finally, the teacher is also easier to reach in case of confusion or questions.

### Ineffective
1. **Exercises set as homework** - For me, it is harder to understand the tasks at home. It is also harder to ask about questions or confusions. In general, I think setting exercises to do in class is much better.

2. **Google form exercises** - For me, these exercises didn't really help me with my understanding of the lesson. It is less engaging and more conceptual rather than application.
